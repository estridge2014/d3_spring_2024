# Basic Markdown Tutorial (Heading 1)

Below you will find a basic tutorial for Markdown. If you need more
help, you might check out the [Markdown
Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) website as one
useful resource.

Note: in VS Code you can download extensions such as the Learn Markdown and Learn
Markdown Preview which will allow you to preview your Readme files before
uploading them to GitHub (for example, there are various extensions
that offer this feature). 

## Styling Text with Markdown (Heading 2)

This is text under a Heading 2. You can always **bold** your text like this. Or, you can *italicize* your text like this. 

You might also want to ~~cross out~~ some of your text like this.

### Combining Styles (Heading 3)

It is also possible to combine various styles, such as ***bolding and italicizing*** your text like this.

## Making Lists (Heading 2)

There are a few kinds of lists that might be useful to you:

- Unordered lists (i.e. bullets, like this list!)
- Ordered lists (i.e. numbered lists)


To make an ordered list, you would just use numbers:

1. First point
2. Second point

When adding an image to your Markdown file you will want to include alt
text the square brackets as well as a file path for your image (or
just the image name if it's in the same folder). Remember to include
the image in your homework folder, and have it properly referenced,
when you upload your materials to GitHub so that it will display in
the Readme.

**Tutorial End.**
