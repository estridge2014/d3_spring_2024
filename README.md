## Savannah Estridge (She/Her)
#### A Little About Me: 

My name is Savannah Estridge (she/her). I am originally from Kentucky but have lived in Brooklyn since 2016. I am currently enrolled in my first semester of the CUNY Master of Science program in Data Analytics and Visualization. Additionally, I work in data science at a non-governmental organization dedicated to human rights. Previously, I was a middle school teacher, specifically as a music instructor for secondary school students.

My goal is to utilize data visualization as a tool to assist others to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of current events, ideas and cultures across the world. I mainly code with R and occasionally python. I'm totally new to D3 and looking forward to picking up the skills to create interactive data visualizations.
